- This version of emulator is built around SDL2 library and because the SDL library does not have remote control keys you should use the provided library or if you build yourself the SDL library you need to patch yourself the library, [OpenPli](https://github.com/OpenPLi/openpli-oe-core/tree/develop/meta-openpli/recipes-graphics/libsdl2) developemnt branch have my patch to add all known remote control keys to SDL2 library
- The package archive contain all libraries and apps you need to install and run the emulator on your Vu+ Solo4K all tested and build under OpenPli 7.2
